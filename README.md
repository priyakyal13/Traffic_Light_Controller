# Traffic-Light-controllerThis Verilog module implements a Traffic Light Controller FSM for a highway and country road intersection.
It uses five states (S0–S4) to manage signal transitions (Red, Yellow, Green) based on a sensor input X. 
It features programmable delays using repeat blocks and ensures safe transitions between highway and country road flows.
